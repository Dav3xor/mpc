Parts of this I'm proud of, parts I wish I had spent more time
on improving my code instead of just producing a whole bunch of it.

I started out using this as an exercise in learning the pytables
library.  I fairly quickly figured out that pytables was going
to make me do most of the work myself, so I decided to just
ditch the library and go it alone in memory.  The dataset
fits fairly comfortably in my laptops main memory, so why not?

Then I quickly found out how much code I was going to have to
write if I didn't use any sort of database, and I got into
a rush to finish before the time limit, not particularly
what I started out to do, but oh well.

Reusability:  I'd think the little ascii spinner class I 
wrote for this could turn into something reusable, and
the schema parser could also be spruced up nicely by
combining it with a container class to hold all
the data.

I generally try to write code using the dry principle, there
are several places where this fails.  particularly where
the pattern "open file, start ascii spinner, <do stuff>
cleanup" is found, I would like to write a decorator to
remove most of the cut and paste...

I would have liked to use more classes; there's no need
to pass the schema around separate from the data.

Also, the organization is ok, but a little messy.

Overall I loved the assignment, this was a lot of fun.  Given
a couple more hours, I'd definitely change some things around
and clean some stuff up, but that's always the case.




to run the program:

1.  you will need Python 2.7+

4.  4 gigs of memory (unless you don't mind letting it swap forever)

2.  copy the data files into the directory containing the python scripts

3.  'python census.py'

4.  wait for it to finish.
